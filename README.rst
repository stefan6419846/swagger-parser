==============

Swagger-parser is a python module giving you access to some interesting data about your swagger file. Like getting a dictionary example from a definition name, get the definition of a dictionary, and more.

Related Libraries

You may find related libraries to this one:

* https://github.com/Trax-air/swagger-tester: Auto-test your swagger API in your unit tests. All test calls are generated by your swagger file.
* https://github.com/Trax-air/swagger-stub: A stub you can use in your client's unit tests. All the HTTP calls to your swagger API are mocked by default. You can also add your own mocked_calls in your test functions.
* https://github.com/Trax-air/swagger-aggregator: Aggregate several swagger specs into one. Useful for your API gateways!

Example Usage
-------------

.. code:: python

  from swagger_parser import SwaggerParser

  parser = SwaggerParser(swagger_path='swagger_path')  # Init with file
  parser = SwaggerParser(swagger_dict={})  # Init with dictionary

  # Get an example of dict for the definition Foo
  parser.definitions_example.get('Foo')

  # Get the definition of a dictionary
  test = {
    'foo': 'bar'
  }
  parser.get_dict_definition(test)

  # Validate the definition of a dict
  parser.validate_definition('Foo', test)

  # Validate that the given data match a path specification
  parser.validate_request('/foo', 'post', body=test, query={'foo': 'bar'})

  # Get the possible return value of a path
  # It will return a dictionary with keys as status_code
  # and value as example of return value.
  parser.get_request_data('/foo', 'post', body=test)

  # Get an example of a correct body for a path
  parser.get_send_request_correct_body('/foo', 'post')

About this fork
---------------

This repository contains my own fork of the package with some basic changes:

* Fix compatibility with recent Python versions and drop Python 2 compatibility code.
* Avoid pinning *pyyaml* on some old beta version.
* Add CI based upon GitHub Actions to run the tests and linting automatically.

For now, I do not have any direct plans to send a corresponding PR due to the upstream
repository not appearing really maintained.
